# News Site
Project News site. Got an assignment to code a webpage where news are published. The reader should be able to click around and read 8 different news. The webpage is adapted to Small/Big Desktop, Table and Mobile Device. 


Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
Firstly, I followed the instructions and read through portals and learning materials to learn how to create flexboxes and grids. Then I started the project by building up the sceleton and create different boxes/sections where my content will be stored. When I was done with the content part, I started to style the layout and that was the final stage.

Majority of my time went to experiment different codes and check if they fit my project or not. This is my first project and many parts are new for me, so I spent a lot of time to only learn different codes which is used in webbuilding. If I had more time, I would polish my page and code and make it even more readable. 




Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
