# News Site
Project News site - Got an assignment to code a webpage where news are published. The user should be able to click around and read 8 different news. The webpage is adapted to Small/Big Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Devices. 

## The problem
First of all, I followed the instructions and read through portals and learning materials to learn how to create flexboxes and grids. Then I started the project by building up the skeleton and created different boxes/sections where my content will be stored. When I was done with the content part, I started to style the layout and that was the final stage.

Majority of my time went to experiment different codes and check if they fit my project or not. This is my first project and many parts are new for me, so I spent a lot of time to only learn different codes which is used in webbuilding. I used not only Technigos learning portal, but also StackOverflow and other portals where materials about HTML and CSS are available.
If I had more time, I would polish my page and code and make it even more readable. I lot of my time also went to read through my CSS code where I tried to delete dublicates. In the end of the project I become better in coding the CSS part and thats what I will do better in the upcoming projects. 


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
